# Pyhton_tkinter_calculator

This repository contains a Python-based calculator application built with Tkinter for the GUI and Pygame for sound effects. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, parentheses, and other operators like modulus, exponentiation, and integer division.

## Key Features:

1) GUI Interface: The calculator has a user-friendly interface built using Tkinter.
2) Sound Effects: Pygame is used to play different sounds for button clicks, errors, corrections, and backspace operations.
3) Error Handling: If an error occurs during calculation, the input field displays "Error" and plays an error sound.
4) Operators: Includes support for basic arithmetic operations, as well as parentheses, exponentiation (**), and integer division (//).

Version 2.1.0.0 introduces error handling where the text box clears if there's an error, and adds support for parentheses in expressions.
